Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```

## The `rgeizhals` package

The `rgheizhals` package can be used to scrape category listings from a
specific product category on [https://geizhals.at/](https://geizhals.at/),
including the links to the detailed product info pages.

To use the package, navigate to a specific geizhals page by selecting
the appropriate page in the sidebar of the page (1) and then choosing
a category that should be scraped (2).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Geizhals main page: Select category", out.width="100%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "./img/geizhals-mainpage.jpg")
```

Furthermore, it is advised that the choices displayed on the page are
limited by choosing the filters (3) that are appropriate for the search
in question. This helps to avoid being banned (temporarily) from the 
geizhals page for issuing too many requests.

Once the listing page contains the information that should be scraped,
the url can be copied from the browser.

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(rgeizhals)
library(dplyr)


## first, define filters on geizhals.
## then, get url:
firstlistpageurl <- "https://geizhals.at/?cat=hwaeschtr&xf=1027_W%E4rmepumpentrockner%7E1296_10%7E1747_8%7E7641_40%7E7653_9"

## most high-level function:
#dat_gh_trockn <- get_geizhals_data(firstlistpageurl, max_pages = 1)
#dat_gh <- dat_gh_trockn
#head(dat_gh)

```

```{r}

# ## pick one detailpage:
# detailpage <- get_detailpage_urls(listpagehtml)[1]
# 
# ## get html of url:
# detailpagehtml <- read_html(detailpage)
# 
# ## just get categories (without values):
# get_detailpage_categories(detailpagehtml)
# 
# ## get categories and their values:
# get_keyval_tbl(detailpagehtml)
# 
# ## get prices (first page):
# get_prices(detailpagehtml)
# 
# ## get summary of prices (first page):
# get_price_summary(detailpagehtml)
# 

```
